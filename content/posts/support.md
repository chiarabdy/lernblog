## AD DS Active Directory Domain Services
is a core component of Microsoft's Windows
1. Keeps Track of Users
    AD DS stores information about all the people (users) in the network. For example, it knows who you are, your job title, and what you’re allowed to do.
    Think of it like an employee directory for the office.
2. Manages Access to Resources
    It controls who can access what. For example:
    You might have permission to open certain files but not others.
    You might be able to print on one printer but not another.
    It’s like having keys to specific rooms in the office, but not all of them.
3. Organizes Everything
    AD DS groups things logically. For example:
    All the employees in the Marketing department are grouped together.
    All the computers in the Sales team are grouped together.
    This makes it easier to manage permissions for groups of people instead of individuals.
4. Helps with Logging In
    When you log in to your computer at work, AD DS checks your username and password to make sure you’re allowed to use the system.
    It’s like the receptionist checking your ID before letting you into the building.
5. Keeps Things Secure
    AD DS ensures that only authorized people can access sensitive information or systems.
    If someone leaves the company, their access can be removed quickly so they can’t get into the network anymore.
