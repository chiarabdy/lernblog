## Python as a calculator
Python is perfectly suited to do basic calculations. Apart from addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, there is also support for more advanced operations such as:
* Exponentiation:`` ** ``. This operator raises the number to its left to the power of the number to its right. For example ``4**2`` will give ``16``.
* Modulo: ``%``. This operator returns the remainder of the division of the number to the left by the number on its right. For example ``18 % 7`` equals ``4``.
## Exercise 001
### instructions
Suppose you have $100, which you can invest with a 10% return each year. After one year, it's 100×1.1=110 dollars, and after two years it's 100×1.1×1.1=121. Add code to calculate how much money you end up with after 7 years, and print the result.
